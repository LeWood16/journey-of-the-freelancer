    <article>
        <p>Today started off at a crawl, with non-code obligations throwing 
        themselves in front of me the whole way. Time to end a typical 
        work day and I'm only getting started. But, here I am. </p> 
        
        <br>
        
        <p>This feels like a diary... and that's not okay with me. But
        in the spirit of yesterday's list, I know I have to create no matter 
        how I feel, or how much time I have. I guess it has to start somewhere.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>I shoot for eight hours a day of development work. Studying concepts, 
        following along with the list of books/classes/projects I found from the 
        FreeCodeCamp forums, and pretending I have clients... lots and lots of clients. 
        </p>
        
        <p>That's all for today. I have eight hours of work and four and a half to do 
        it in. But, in the spirit of daily self-improving, and knowing my work can always 
        improve, I'm going to start giving a list of things I've done better today than 
        yesterday, no matter how small they seem.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Styled my paragraph tags for better readability</li>
            <li>Took out my scripts file, as I don't have any JavaScript
            needs in this blog</li>
            <li>Created a separate directory for blog entries, to keep my 
            repository as decluttered as possible</li>
            <li>Planning on using a templating system for styling the homepage 
            and listing my past entries, to keep my code DRY</li>
        </ul>
