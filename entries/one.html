      <p>It's been about three weeks since I quit my job in retail...  I took a vacation that just kept on going. Coding has been something I've done for hours a day for years, something I've dreamed of doing professionally.</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p>And I'm still dreaming. Twenty days gone by, and nothing tangible to show for it.</p>
      
      <br> 
      
      <p>These last few weeks have taught me a lot about just where I stand as far as my marketable skills are concerned. Today was especially eye-opening, when someone was on the Brimley Sales Facebook page and noticed someone wanted a webpage made.</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p>I panicked.  I spend hours a day every day getting better at web development, and no time actually making sites/apps/etc. So here I am, throwing together a blog, the first thing I've actually "pushed to production" in all the years I've been on this journey.</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p>Here's to many more.</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p>Before I forget the lessons today has taught me, I'll try to distill them into a list for my future self:</p>
  
      <ul>
        <li>Forget about making a project perfect; It'll never be perfect, but it can always improve. Just get it done, then improve it.</li>
        
        <li>Limit your daily study time, and focus on making things.</li>
        
        <li>Web design is not programming. Period. Years of recreational programming on its own has given me no income, but a few months of recreational website-making very well might.</li>
        
      </ul>
