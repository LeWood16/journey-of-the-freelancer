    <article>
        <p>Spent quite a few hours frantically getting my portfolio ready yesterday 
        before sending it along. It made me painfully aware of how much time I spend 
        on getting better at programming, and how little I spend on website design and 
        development.  It looks good under the hood, but clients don't care about that 
        nearly as much as I thought they would.</p> 
        
        <br>
        
        <p>To the disgust and disappointment of my family, I'm here at the library instead 
        of spending Easter Sunday having dinner with them. This is the last holiday I'll 
        ever spend like this; It's not fair to anyone, least of all my brother.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>So, here I am, determined to spend today making my sites and apps look 
        considerably less like they were put together by a five-year-old. From now on, 
        improving on design aspects get their place in my daily routine.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Form is just as important as function; Sometimes more so</li>
            <li>Get less into "I'm spending X arbitrary hours on getting better" and more into 
            "today I'm accomplishing X Y and Z."</li>
            <li>Plan on giving people more of your time, for your own sanity.</li>
        </ul>
