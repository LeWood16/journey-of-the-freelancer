        <p>I've tried to tie together all the tips I've gotten on learning as quickly and as 
        comprehensively as possible. This is what I've come up with:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use the Feynman technique.</strong> Study, then try explaining it; if you can't
            explain quickly in simple language, study some more.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep a log of what you learn, so you can go back over it regularly.</strong> 
            Go back the next day and explain it again; then a week later; then a month later; then every 
            month after that.</li>
            <li><strong>When studying, make a list of subconcepts you don't understand or need a deeper 
            understanding of.</strong> You can't explain something simply if you don't understand 
            terms and concepts being used to explain it (i.e. "sub-concepts").</li>
            <li><strong>Keep listing sub-concepts until you hit bottom. Then start there.</strong> When 
            you've gotten down to a level where you can understand everything being explained, 
            use the Feynman technique until you've mastered that concept; do that with all relevant sub-concepts, 
            then tackle the parent concept.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The template I've been using is pretty simple, there are only three parts:</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <ol>
            <li>What is it?</li>
            <li>What is it for?</li>
            <li>Give examples (minimum of three)</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Each concept gets a single page (one-sided). Keep the pages handy in a folder, so you can study them 
        regularly. Try to write the page again when it's that concept's turn to be re-explained. If you make a 
        better study page, keep the new one. If not, keep the old one.</p>
